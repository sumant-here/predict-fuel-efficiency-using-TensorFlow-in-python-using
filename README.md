## ‚õΩ Predict Fuel Efficiency Using TensorFlow in Python

This project predicts the fuel efficiency of vehicles using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in Python with the help of TensorFlow. It uses historical vehicle data like horsepower, weight, and model year to estimate how fuel-efficient a vehicle is (measured in MPG).

### üìÅ What's Inside This Repository?

* **Dataset.txt**: This file contains the raw vehicle data used to train and test the model.
* **Fuel Efficiency using ANN.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that walks through data cleaning, training the ANN model, and evaluating the results.
* **model/**: This folder stores the trained machine learning model so you can reuse it without retraining.
* **TEMPLATE/**: Contains supporting files for rendering or extending the project (e.g., UI or additional logic).
* **requirements.txt**: Lists all Python libraries required to run the notebook and train the model.
* **README.md**: You're reading it! This file gives a summary of the project.

### üß† What This Project Does

* Loads and preprocesses car data from `Dataset.txt`
* Trains a neural network using TensorFlow to predict miles-per-gallon (MPG)
* Evaluates model performance using loss metrics
* Saves the model for future use

### üöÄ Why This Is Useful

Fuel efficiency is a key factor for both environmental and cost concerns. This model helps estimate how efficient a car might be based on its specifications, which can help users make informed decisions.
